# express-starter

An express starter app written in ES6 syntax that functions as a REST API connected to a MongoDB database.

### download/configure

1. download

```
git clone https://github.com/joshterrill/express-starter
cd express-starter/
npm install
```


2. configure by replacing the `<username>, <password>, <database>` values in `.env.example` with real values, and then rename it to just `.env`.

### build and run

```
npm start
or
npm run dev
```

Still a work in progress.
