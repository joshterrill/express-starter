# express-starter

An express starter app written in ES6 syntax that functions as a REST API connected to a MongoDB database.

### download/configure

1. download

```
git clone https://github.com/joshterrill/express-starter
cd express-starter/
npm install
```

2. configure by replacing the values in `src/config.json.example` with real values, and then rename it to just `config.json`.

### build and run

```
npm run build
npm start (or nodemon)
```

This should create a `dist/` folder that your app will execute from.

Still a work in progress.
